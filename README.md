### [Level 1] Challenge: Node.js concepts :rocket:
Application developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) that manages repositories and allows creation, listing, updating and removal, as well as allowing repositories to receive "likes".

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) was used for request tests. The `Insomnia_Repositories.json` file in this repository can be imported into Insomnia to save time. :wink:

### Running Locally

```sh
# install packages
yarn

# run server and start app
yarn dev
```
